# Heads up!
- **This is just extras.**
- **Sadly, there's not a WIKI yet.** :(
## Thank you for reading. Now let's talk about the real stuff.
### This mod adds:
- New helpful commands (gmc, gms, gma, gmsp)
- Nothing else so far. If you manage to find something that you suggested in here, it's only gonna be there until specified which other mod it belongs to.

~~I also have no care if you just dip this, I just want to show off my modding skills.~~ <- **This is a joke by the way. I really do care if you download this.** Oh and I have been working on this since **2019**. I'm only deciding to upload this now.
